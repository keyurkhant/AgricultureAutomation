# Agriculture Automation with Crop Yield Prediction

## Abstract

Indian Agriculture occupies around 50% of Indian population. In this scenario, more agriculture production is required with increasing population while environmental footprint is reduced and customer satisfaction is increased with minimal resources. Until the last century farmers have depended on rainfall to be their source of water. But now with the availability of irrigation systems, it is possible to improve agriculture's traditional techniques. For that “Agriculture Automation System with Crop & Crop Yield Prediction” gives some solutions for the problem. From this we can design one automation irrigation system using the Internet of Things and also do crop and soil monitoring and management. So, it is useful for prediction of crops for next season and also gives some information about your crop’s market price and predicted yield.
